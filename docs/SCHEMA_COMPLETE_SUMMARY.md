## 💡 How the Schemas Work

### Example: Pricing Page

When someone searches "AI SEO tool pricing", Google can now show:

```
AISEOTurbo - AI-Powered SEO Audits
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.8 (1,000 reviews)
www.aiseoturbo.com › pricing

Plans from $0/month
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Free Plan - $0/month
Professional - $49/month  
Enterprise - $199/month

❓ How does the AI SEO audit work?
❓ Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime?
❓ Do you offer refunds?
```

This is called a **Rich Result** - it stands out much more than plain text!

## 🎯 Key Features of Our Implementation

### 1. **Type Safety**
All schemas use TypeScript interfaces for type checking:
```typescript
interface ProductSchemaInput {
  name: string
  description: string
  price: string
  currency: string
  url: string
  features?: string[]
}
```

### 2. **Reusability**
Generate schemas with simple function calls:
```typescript
const productSchema = generateProductSchema({
  name: "AISEOTurbo Pro Plan",
  description: "Professional SEO audits",
  price: "49",
  currency: "USD",
  url: "https://www.aiseoturbo.com/pricing",
  features: ["Unlimited audits", "Advanced analysis"]
})
```

### 3. **Easy to Extend**
Add new schema types by following the pattern:
```typescript
export function generateNewSchema(input: NewSchemaInput) {
  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "NewType",
    // ... properties
  }
}
```

### 4. **Single Source of Truth**
All business info (contact emails, founder, location) in one place:
- Organization schema in `app/layout.tsx`
- Appears on every page automatically
