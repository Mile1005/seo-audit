# üöÄ Dashboard Page Crawler - Deployment Checklist

**Feature:** Professional Page Crawler for Dashboard  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Deployment

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

All code has been written and is ready to deploy!

---

## üì¶ What Was Built

### ‚úÖ Backend (3 API Routes)
- [x] `POST /api/dashboard/page-crawler/start` - Start crawl
- [x] `GET /api/dashboard/page-crawler/status` - Get progress
- [x] `GET /api/dashboard/page-crawler/list` - List history

### ‚úÖ Frontend (1 Page)
- [x] `/dashboard/page-crawler` - Full UI with tabs, filters, export

### ‚úÖ Integration
- [x] Added to dashboard navigation sidebar
- [x] Updated Prisma schema
- [x] Increased quota limits

### ‚úÖ Documentation (4 Files)
- [x] SITE_CRAWLER_ANALYSIS.md - Original analysis
- [x] PAGE_CRAWLER_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Technical docs
- [x] PAGE_CRAWLER_QUICKSTART.md - User guide
- [x] PAGE_CRAWLER_SUMMARY.md - Overview

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with new schema
npx prisma generate

# Create migration for the new 'type' field
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_crawl_type_field

# This will add the 'type' column to the Crawl table
```

**What this does:**
- Adds `type` column to `Crawl` table
- Sets default value to "STANDARD"
- Adds index for performance
- Safe to run (non-destructive)

### 2. Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### For Development

```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Run database migration
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_crawl_type_field

# 3. Restart server
npm run dev
```

### For Production (Vercel)

```bash
# 1. Ensure environment variables are set
# - DATABASE_URL
# - NEXTAUTH_SECRET
# - NEXTAUTH_URL

# 2. Push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Dashboard Page Crawler"
git push origin main

# 3. Vercel will auto-deploy

# 4. Run migration in production database
# Option A: Via Vercel CLI
vercel env pull
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Option B: Via database provider dashboard
# Execute SQL: ALTER TABLE "Crawl" ADD COLUMN "type" TEXT DEFAULT 'STANDARD';
# Execute SQL: CREATE INDEX "Crawl_type_idx" ON "Crawl"("type");
```

### For Self-Hosted

```bash
# 1. Pull code on server
ssh user@server
cd /path/to/app
git pull origin main

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run migration
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Restart application
pm2 restart app
# or
systemctl restart your-app
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Smoke Tests
- [ ] Load `/dashboard/page-crawler` - should work
- [ ] Start a crawl - should complete
- [ ] View results - should display
- [ ] Export CSV - should download
- [ ] Check history - should show crawl

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Crawl starts immediately
- [ ] Progress updates every 2 seconds
- [ ] Results load quickly

### Database Checks
```sql
-- Verify migration
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'Crawl' AND column_name = 'type';

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'Crawl';

-- Verify data
SELECT id, type, status, pages FROM "Crawl" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] No API errors (500s)
- [ ] No timeout issues
- [ ] Successful crawl completions

---

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Crawl Success Rate**
   - Target: > 95%
   - Alert if < 90%

2. **Average Crawl Time**
   - 10 pages: < 2 minutes
   - 50 pages: < 10 minutes
   - 100 pages: < 20 minutes

3. **Error Rate**
   - Target: < 5%
   - Types: Timeouts, fetch failures, parse errors

4. **Quota Usage**
   - Track crawls per user
   - Identify heavy users
   - Plan for scaling

5. **Page Load Performance**
   - Dashboard page: < 2 seconds
   - Results view: < 1 second
   - Export: < 500ms

### Dashboard Queries

```sql
-- Crawls in last 24 hours
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Crawl" 
WHERE type = 'DASHBOARD' 
AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Success rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'COMPLETED') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as success_rate
FROM "Crawl" 
WHERE type = 'DASHBOARD';

-- Average pages per crawl
SELECT AVG(pages) FROM "Crawl" 
WHERE type = 'DASHBOARD' AND status = 'COMPLETED';

-- Top users by crawl count
SELECT "ownerId", COUNT(*) as crawl_count
FROM "Crawl" c
JOIN "Project" p ON c."projectId" = p.id
WHERE c.type = 'DASHBOARD'
GROUP BY "ownerId"
ORDER BY crawl_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: JavaScript-Heavy Sites
**Problem:** Sites that require JavaScript won't render properly  
**Workaround:** Mention in UI that JavaScript rendering is not supported  
**Future Fix:** Implement Puppeteer/Playwright

### Issue 2: Rate Limiting
**Problem:** Some sites may block rapid requests  
**Workaround:** Users should use reasonable page limits  
**Future Fix:** Add configurable delays between requests

### Issue 3: Server Restart Loses Jobs
**Problem:** In-memory job store is cleared on restart  
**Impact:** Active crawls will fail  
**Workaround:** Database records persist, show as failed  
**Future Fix:** Move to Redis or database-backed queue

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common User Issues

**"I can't find Page Crawler"**
‚Üí Check sidebar navigation, between Site Audit and Backlinks

**"Crawl won't start"**
‚Üí Check:
1. Are you logged in?
2. Have you reached quota (5/month)?
3. Is URL valid?

**"Results not showing"**
‚Üí Wait for crawl to complete, check progress bar

**"Export doesn't work"**
‚Üí Check browser popup blocker

**"Pages missing from results"**
‚Üí Check for:
1. robots.txt blocking
2. Timeout errors
3. Invalid links

### Developer Issues

**Migration fails**
```bash
# Reset and retry
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev
```

**API returns 500**
```bash
# Check logs
npm run dev
# Look for errors in terminal
```

**Database connection error**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL
echo $DATABASE_URL
# Test connection
npx prisma db pull
```
