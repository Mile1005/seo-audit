# üöÄ CI/CD & Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the complete CI/CD pipeline setup and production deployment process for AI SEO Turbo.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Pipeline Overview
Our CI/CD pipeline consists of 6 main jobs:

1. **Test Suite** - Linting, type checking, unit tests, and build verification
2. **E2E & Accessibility Tests** - End-to-end testing and WCAG compliance
3. **Performance Audit** - Lighthouse CI performance testing
4. **Security Scan** - Security auditing and CodeQL analysis
5. **Deploy Preview** - Automatic preview deployments for PRs
6. **Deploy Production** - Production deployment on main branch

### Pipeline Triggers
- **Push to `main`**: Full pipeline + production deployment
- **Push to `develop`**: Full pipeline (no deployment)
- **Pull Requests to `main`**: Full pipeline + preview deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Secrets
Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Vercel Configuration
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id

# Application Secrets
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

# Notifications (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK=your_slack_webhook_url
```

### 2. Branch Protection Rules
Set up branch protection for `main`:

```bash
# Required status checks
- test (Test Suite)
- e2e-tests (E2E & Accessibility Tests)
- performance-audit (Performance Audit)
- security-scan (Security Scan)

# Additional rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Dismiss stale reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to matching branches
```

### 3. Vercel Configuration
Ensure your `vercel.json` is properly configured:

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
  "devCommand": "pnpm dev",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "env": {
    "NEXTAUTH_SECRET": "@nextauth_secret",
    "NEXTAUTH_URL": "@nextauth_url",
    "DATABASE_URL": "@database_url"
  }
}
```

## üìä Quality Gates

### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: 90% pass rate minimum
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile interactions
- **Screen Reader**: All interactive elements must have accessible names

### Performance Requirements
- **Performance Score**: 80+ (Lighthouse)
- **Accessibility Score**: 90+ (Lighthouse)
- **Best Practices**: 90+ (Lighthouse)
- **SEO Score**: 90+ (Lighthouse)

### Security Requirements
- **No high-severity vulnerabilities** in dependencies
- **CodeQL analysis** must pass
- **Security headers** properly configured

## üîß Test Commands

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run accessibility tests
pnpm test:accessibility

# Run type checking
pnpm type-check

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Performance audit
pnpm lhci
```

### CI Environment
```bash
# CI-optimized E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e:ci

# CI-optimized accessibility tests
pnpm test:accessibility:ci

# Security audit
pnpm audit
```

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Preview Deployments
1. Create/update a Pull Request to `main`
2. Pipeline automatically runs all tests
3. If tests pass, preview deployment is created
4. Preview URL is provided in PR comments
5. Manual testing and review can be performed

### Production Deployment
1. Merge PR to `main` branch
2. Full pipeline runs with all quality gates
3. If all checks pass, production deployment starts
4. Health check validates deployment
5. Slack notification sent (if configured)

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Using Vercel CLI
vercel rollback [deployment-url]

# Or redeploy previous commit
git revert [commit-hash]
git push origin main
```
