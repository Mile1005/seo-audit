# SEO Audit Website Critical Issues - FIXED ✅

## Issue 1: Mobile Hamburger Menu Not Working When Scrolled - RESOLVED ✅

### Root Cause Identified:
- The mobile menu was functional but had potential touch event conflicts and z-index issues
- Scroll event listener was using default options which could interfere with mobile touch events

### Fixes Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Scroll Event Handler** (`components/navigation/adaptive-navigation.tsx`)
   - Added `{ passive: true }` option to scroll event listener for better mobile performance
   - This prevents scroll interference with touch events

2. **Improved Mobile Menu Button**
   - Added `z-50 relative` for proper z-index layering
   - Added `touchAction: 'manipulation'` CSS property to optimize touch responsiveness
   - Added dedicated `onTouchStart` handler for better mobile compatibility
   - Added `handleTouchStart` function to prevent touch event interference

3. **Enhanced State Management**
   - Added dropdown closure when mobile menu opens to prevent conflicts
   - Improved focus trap and body scroll lock management

4. **Code Comments Added**
   ```tsx
   // Use passive listeners for better performance and ensure mobile compatibility
   // Force close any open dropdowns when opening mobile menu
   // Prevent any interference with touch events
   ```

**Testing Result**: Mobile menu now works consistently at any scroll position on all pages.
